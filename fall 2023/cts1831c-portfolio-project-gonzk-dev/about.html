                <p>Hello, thanks for visiting my website! This website was made with the intent to provide a home for all of my works, as well as a showcase of my programming abilities. I've been programming for about 3 years now, and I've been illustrating for as long as I can remember. If I'm to make a website that represents me, it'd only make sense to add as much of myself to its design, right?</p>
                
                <h2>Expect to see</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>You should expect to see a lot of art and characters on some of my more intricate pages. <strong>Don't think too hard about it!</strong> They're just silly little creatures.</p>
                <p>Also, expect to see a lot of more experimental code like image maps. A lot of this is just me experimenting and having fun with programming to add a charm to my website. Hope you like it as much as I do.</p>
