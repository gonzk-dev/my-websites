                <p>I like to think I learned a lot while building. I'm really proud of what I've done. I just hope to not lose all that I've learned from this class between these semesters. I plan on taking Web Auth II next semester so I can learn more and improve on what I know and get better. I really want to learn good webdesign and how to make appealing, readable pages. This page will really help in my career as it provides an easily accessible archive of all of my work while working as proof on its own about my capabilities as a future web developer.</p>

                <p>I hope to see everyone next semester, this class was really fun but challenging.</p>
