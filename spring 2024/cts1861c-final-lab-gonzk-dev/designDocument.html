                <li>Feel: The website would be very minimalist, with soft and appealing colors. Visitors will be able to change the site theme to their liking, like a dark or light theme for the best viewing experience. Both theme options will play into the company's brand colors to remain consistent to the brand.</li>
            </ol>

            <!-- START OF LAB 3-->
            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Problem: User encounters an error in the website. This report is documented, and referenced if a similar issue has been reported before. The issue is then analyzed, the steps the user took are replicated as accurately as possible to recreate the problem encountered. Once the problem is found, a solution is designed, with theories and ideas of what the solution could be. The solution is prototyped and then tested on the site. If the error remains, restart the process, if not, evaluate and finally document the findings for future reference.</li>
                <li>Activity: User wants to have a more interesting experience on the site. This concern and the steps taken are documented. First, we must evaluate what is it that the user wants, whether it is feasible, and if it matches the site vision. Then we design a concept. The concept is then prototyped and it is put to the test. If the activity makes the site engaging, it is kept, and if not then it is disposed of.</li>
                <li>Information: User wants to find information about web design principles. They first browse through the website. For the user's ease, the website is designed with a search bar for them. The user puts it to the test. If they find what they are looking for, then it is a success, if not, the site search and the page (if it exists) must be updated immediately.</li>
                <li>Interaction: User is navigating through the website, and wishes to find the site resume. They are most likely to use the navigation bar, so one must be available and easy to use. It must be designed to be minimalist, and always accessible. When the user uses it, it should allow for easy navigation of the site. If it does not, then this is unfriendly user design and makes the website look less reliable for it.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Cognitive Psychology Principles</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>"Users dislike having to think and work hard to get tasks done" means that the site has to do all of the hard work for the user. Our users look to our website for advice and services, so if we cannot easily provide them with that information the site will fail. Our response is to make links simple, and provide search engines so our pages are easily found.</li>
                <li>"Users have limitations" means that users cannot handle a lot of information and things to look at at the same time. This website is supposed to be inviting for all, so simple and soft colors with not too much cluttering the screen is necessary.</li>
                <li>"Users make mistakes" means that a user will always input something wrong. Our users may sometimes make a spelling mistake in the search, or misread something or interact with the wrong tool. Our site should be flexible, allow to correct the user on a common miss-spelling of a word or refer them to pages they can visit if the search engine pulls up nothing. These errors should not break the site or inconvenience the user.</li>
                <li>"Users have imperfect memories" means users are prone to forgetting things.Our site is meant to be accessible, so all necessary information should always be at the user's immediate use.</li>
                <li>"Users are social animals" means they crave human interaction. Our site is one that is intended to be friendly. So inviting, cheerful language should be used in blog posts and any responses to users.</li>
                <li>"Users have selective attention" means users have fickle attention and anything can take their eyes away from what you intend to show them if its not defined. It is important a user understands what they see on our website, whether it be pricing information or the navigation bar. So, we must use colors, typography, and more to emphasize the most important information, while less important information should be minimalist.</li>
                <li>"Users crave information" means users love to learn and explore. Our site provides many articles, so our users must be able to access and enjoy those pages.</li>
                <li>Users are driven by their unconscious mind" means uses do things they do not even realize they do all the time. Our website has a lot of things to do, so we must design things so that the user unconsciously understands what is it they can and cannot interact with, what does what, by following design conventions most websites use and easy to understand language.</li>
                <li>"Users rely on mental models" means user rely on organizing information into bits and pieces so they are easily digestible. Our website will be large, so we must organize everything into categories, so that if the user wants to access the commissions, they are not then taken to an entirely irrelevant page that they did not expect.</li>
                <li>"Users have imperfect vision" means users will either have failing eyes or occasionally misread and misinterpret something they saw. The site must be easily readable with those with impaired vision, and understand that users occasionally misinterpret something they saw.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Critical Tasks (case)</h2>
            <p><b>Task 1:</b> Commissioning a website. Goal: to send in a request for a website. Description: user is to order a website by inputting their name, email, and description of what they need. Actors: Julia Rosa.

Main Success Scenario: User successfully inputs all required information and it is sent to the company server for review. Extension: All information is inputted and makes sense. Post Conditions: User must then be reached out to.</p>
            <p><b>Task 2:</b> Accessing a blog post. Goal: to find and access a blog post. Description: user is to search and browse through the blog section of the website and find a post that pertains to their interest. Actors: Korina Napolitani. Preconditions: User is already in the Blogs section of the website. Main Success Scenario: User successfully finds and accesses a blog post written by the company. Extension: The search bar and all blog posts are tagged and working appropriately. Post Conditions: User can continue browsing in peace with no issues.</p>

            <h2>Branding Plan</h2>
            <p>Our company audience for now will most likely be hobbyists and some clients looking for advice. Our goal for the future is that eventually even professionals will refer to our website as a reliable source for engaging, up-to-date trends for web design. Our company is unique in that it aims for a chic aesthetic and allows for those even with little knowledge in web design to access our site. Our loyal customers are the types that want to remain up to date with trends and advancements while not compromising on a unique website.</p>

            <p>Currently, the company logo is rough. I'm not sure what exactly to make it. However, I imagine it'd be very simple, with only one color that changes depending on the background to allow for contrast. It'd be bold, and would sit next to the company title on the header. On the navy blue header, itd be the same off-white the text and the background color uses. on a white background however, itd be the navy blue.
            <br>
            I plan to include the three primary colors of the website, and then the hues and tints used for each of those, and how those colors will be used in what context.
            </p>

            <!-- START OF LAB 4 -->
            <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
            <h3>Manual Picking</h3>
            <p>The results of manual picking is what is visible right now on the screen. I first picked the color I associate most with "sulfur," a very dull blue (#3e405a) and after that was picked I went from there.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Complementary: #3e405a, #5a4c3e</li>
                <li>Analogous: #3e405a, #4b3e5a, #3e5a58</li>
                <li>Monochromatic: #3e405a, #393d74</li>
                <li>Triadic: #3e405a, #5a5a3e, #5a3e3f</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Color CC</h3>
            <p>I found using Color CC much easier than manually picking, but I don't think I'm happy with most of the results. With the exception of monochromatic and some of the pastels of the triadic colors, I do not think I will be using most of these colors.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Complementary: #2CDBDB, #9C6646, #DB6D2C, #488686, #5C4A40, #3A3E3E</li>
