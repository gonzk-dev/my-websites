# Past Websites
These are websites I have made in the past for college.
I'll be explaining the process of how I made them here and the goal of the websites, as well as any additional credit given to partners, inspirations, etc. For a lot of the earlier sites, you will be seeing personal art I have made for myself and have then put into the websites.

## Fall 2023
These are the first of the websites I've made for college for my Web Authoring I class. While not the first overall, as I have done personal side projects, these are the first I've made while properly learning HTML as a serious career path rather than a hobby.

### Visual Novel Club Homepage

This is the "cts1831c-myclub-lab-gonzk-dev" folder, the color palette is a dark green and a musty grey. I do not remember the thought process I had while making this. This is the first website I built, made for an assignment meant to introduce the students to HTML and how to build the websites before learning how to make the website look good.

### Portfolio Project

This is the "cts1831c-portfolio-project-gonzk-dev" folder. A portfolio project that acted as the final for the Web Authoring I class. The initial plans for this site were a lot more ambitious, as I wanted to have image links edited to be monochrome until the user hovers over, and they become lush with color. None of that came to fruition, however. The website structure is not too dissimilar to the Visual Novel Club Homepage, though with some changes.
I remember wishing to go for a muted minimalism style, while still trying to give the site some personality, hence why so much of my own artwork is used.

## Spring 2024
I came into this next semester and Web Authoring II incredibly confident, and ambitious, and started using proper guidelines and tools for web design like Figma. I believe it shows in these next two works.

### Sulfur Flower Designs

This is the "cts1861c-final-lab-gonzk-dev" folder. This was an ongoing project, where we got little bits and pieces of the site done before finally building the whole thing. We were to build a website meant for web design consultation services, and my main theme was minimalism and modern internet design philosophies. I was still a little new to planning out my websites on anything but my head, so there is a vast difference between the working designs before this final design here. I'm still incredibly proud of it, however I would change the font used to be a sans-serif for the paragraph texts to improve the readability, and I would've also loved to have gone in and made it mobile-friendly.

## CSS Zen Garden

This is the final project for the Web Authoring II class, and it was a group project. The goal was to make a unique website out of solely CSS, we were given the HTML but could not edit anything about it. Two peers and I worked together on the project, and agreed to make it a minimalist ocean theme, with the above the fold being the surface with the sun, and below the fold being the ocean.
I created the initial design on Figma, so we could have a shared vision to the direction of the website. My teammates, Abel and Cody, got the basic foundations of the website, and then I came in to polish the visual aspects, like the underline of links and the colors. The wave and sun are images made by myself using my software, with the waves being a near seamless texture while the sun is a flat image that adjusts its scale depending on the screen size. I also made sure that this site is mobile friendly.
The version on this portfolio is not the one we submitted, actually. Cody used experimental code that was not yet validated for wide use across multiple platforms, so we had to remove it or else we would get points deducted.
